     * Promise _and_ the provided Promise to resolve or fail, _even in error cases_. In most practical
     * use cases, that would create a possibility for the Worker to hang indefinitely if the Worker
     * was stopped due to "unexpected" factors
     *
     * For example, in the common test idiom show below, sending a `SIGINT` to the process would
     * initiate shutdown of the Worker, potentially resulting in termination of the Worker before the
     * Workflow completes; in that case, the Workflow would never complete, and consequently, the
     * `runUntil` Promise would never resolve, leaving the process in a hang state.
     *
     * ```ts
     * await Worker.runUntil(() => client.workflow.execute(...));
     * ```
     *
     * The behavior of `Worker.runUntil(...)` has therefore been changedin 1.11.3 so that if the worker
     * shuts down before the inner promise completes, `runUntil` will allow no more than a certain delay
     * (i.e. `promiseCompletionTimeout`) for the inner promise to complete, after which a
     * {@link PromiseCompletionTimeoutError} is thrown.
     *
     * In most practical use cases, no delay is actually required; `promiseCompletionTimeout` therefore
     * defaults to 0 second, meaning the Worker will not wait for the inner promise to complete.
     * You may adjust this value in the very rare cases where waiting is pertinent; set it to a
     * very high value to mimic the previous behavior.
     *
     * This time is calculated from the moment the Worker reachs either the `STOPPED` or the `FAILED`
     * state. {@link Worker.runUntil} throws a {@link PromiseCompletionTimeoutError} if the if the
     * Promise still hasn't completed after that delay.
     *
     * @default 0 don't wait
